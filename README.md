GBA emulator written in C

This is a Gameboy Advance emulator written in C. It's in early stages of development, but most games should work.
There's no sound and PPU emulation is incomplete.

You will need SDL2 to compile it, on Windows it can be compiled by running the Make file if you have MingW installed.

Code is also still a bit messy and needs more optimizations.
